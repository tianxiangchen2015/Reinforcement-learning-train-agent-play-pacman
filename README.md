Reinforcement learning: Train An Agent Play Pacman Game Using Neural Network

======================

Installation
------------

Pac-man requires **Python 2.x** (tested on versions 2.6 and 2.7), and the
corresponding version of the Pygame library, freely available online. Make sure
you install the matching (32- or 64-bit) version of Pygame as your Python
installation, and the one compatible with your Python version number. 

pybrain library is also needed.

### Agent play

The main program is /pacman-python-master/pacman/pacman.pyw
run pacman.pyw file then you can see the agent running Ms. Pac-man to eat Pac-dots

### Acknowledge

Thanks to David Reilly for provding pacman code.
Thanks to pyBrain team for the easy using library for neural network.
